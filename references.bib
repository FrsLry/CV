	abstract = {Empirical quantification of biodiversity changes remains a challenge even in well surveyed groups such as birds. This may be because the change depends on spatio-temporal scales, specifically on spatial grain (i.e. area of a sampling unit), geographic extent (i.e. size of the area of interest), temporal grain (i.e. duration of a sampling event), and temporal extent (i.e. length of the time series). Further, different metrics of biodiversity may exhibit different trends. Here we review global literature assessing the temporal trends of avian biodiversity from ca 1900 AD to present, focusing on studies summarising trends across many locations within a larger region (i.e. spatially replicated). From each study we extracted direction of average trend (increase, decrease, stable), spatial and temporal grains and extents at which trends have been assessed, metrics of biodiversity, and location. We then discuss the trends as a function of the spatio-temporal grains and extents they are defined at. We found 59 trends of 12 metrics, where each trend is an average of trends from multiple sites (spatial replicates). There was a tendency of biodiversity metrics to increase at local and regional spatial scales, and to not increase globally. We thus confirmed that biodiversity dynamics can have opposite trends at different spatial scales. Concerning temporal grain, it was poorly documented across the studies, with inconsistent definitions, and we suggest a common framework to better understand the link between temporal scales and biodiversity dynamics. We have also identified underrepresented regions (those outside North America and Europe), periods (those before the 70’s), and biodiversity metrics that need further attention. We highlight the importance of considering both spatial and temporal scaling jointly in any assessment of biodiversity change, and provide guidelines for how to do this effectively both in birds, and in other taxa.},

	abstract = {The ICESat-2 ATL08 land and vegetation product includes several flags that can be used for the assessment of LiDAR-environment interactions and can help select data of the highest quality. However, the usability of these flags has not been sufficiently studied to date. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of atmospheric scattering, the presence of snow, canopy cover, terrain slope, beam strength, and solar angle on the accuracy of terrain and canopy height of the ATL08 product as well as on providing recommendations on how to filter data in order to minimize errors. We evaluated the vertical accuracy of ATL08 terrain and canopy height in European mountains by comparing them with the digital terrain model and canopy height model derived from airborne laser scanning data. Our results indicate that the assessment of atmospheric effects using the cloud confidence flag (cloud\_flag\_atm; i.e. number of cloud layers) is better than the previously used multiple scattering warning flag (msw\_flag). Day acquisitions with more than one layer of clouds yielded a terrain elevation RMSE of 3.22 m in forests while night acquisitions with no more than a single layer of clouds resulted in RMSE of 1.73 m. The increasing atmospheric scattering effects increased the photons' path length, resulting in terrain height underestimation. The presence of snow had a strong positive effect on the number of identified ground photons, independently of the canopy cover, but resulted in an overestimation of terrain height in higher altitudes. Accordingly, the presence of snow cover resulted in a significant underestimation of canopy height in forests. The canopy height in broadleaf/mixed as well as coniferous forests was in summer underestimated on average by 2.1 m (\%ME of −15.3\%) and 1.2 m (\%ME of −8.2\%), respectively; in winter, however, the underestimation increased to 8.5 m (\%ME of −56.8\%) and 5.7 m (\%ME of −38.3\%), respectively. Canopy height estimates had better accuracy for the strong beam (RMSE of 5.09 m; \%RMSE of 35.4\%) than for the weak beam (RMSE of 7.03 m; \%RMSE of 51.3\%). Our results show that the ATL08 terrain height accuracy decreases with uneven distribution of signal photons within individual segments and further deteriorates with increasing terrain slope. Filtering out segments with poor distribution of photons, more than one layer of clouds during the day, and snow cover in high altitudes is the best approach for minimizing the error while maximizing the number of segments left for subsequent analysis.},
